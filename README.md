      ## Rationale
      # Rationale for Proposed Architecture

## Chosen Cloud-Native Patterns and Components
The proposed architecture utilizes microservices to decouple the functionalities of the existing monolithic COBOL application. Key components include:
- **API Gateway** for managing external requests and routing them to appropriate services.
- **Microservices** to handle specific business functionalities independently, improving scalability and maintainability.
- **Database as a Service (RDS)** with PostgreSQL for modern data handling capabilities.
- **Load Balancers** to distribute traffic across services, ensuring high availability.
- **CloudFront and S3** for static asset delivery and storage.

## Technology Decisions and Justification
- **AWS** was chosen as the cloud provider for its extensive services fitting financial regulations, reliability, and global presence.
- **PostgreSQL** is chosen for its compatibility with complex queries and transactions, alongside strong community support.
- **Docker** for containerization, ensuring consistent deployments and efficient resource utilization.

## Benefits
- **Scalability**: Microservices allow independent scaling based on demand, particularly during peak transactions.
- **Cost-Effectiveness**: Pay-per-use pricing policies reduce operational costs significantly compared to maintaining a mainframe.
- **Security**: IAM roles and policies enforce the principle of least privilege, minimizing access risks.
- **Resilience**: The architecture ensures high availability through redundancy and load balancing.

## Alignment with Industry Context
This architecture aligns with the finance industry's need for operational efficiency, regulatory compliance, and the demand for fast feature delivery.

      ## Architectural Decision Record (ADR)
      # Architectural Decision Record
## Problem(s) to Solve
The current financial application suffers from performance bottlenecks, a monolithic architecture that limits scalability, an outdated technology stack, and insufficient monitoring capabilities.

## Analysis Performed
Analysis of modern architectures was conducted, focusing on microservices, containerization, and cloud capabilities. Additionally, financial regulations were reviewed to ensure compliance.

## Decision and Justification
The decision to transition to a microservices architecture on AWS was made to enhance scalability, reduce operational risks, and improve customer experience. By adopting cloud services, the company can mitigate the issues presented by the legacy system and achieve faster, more efficient operations.
